Blackjack is a card game where players aim to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. Each card numbered card has that value and each face card has a value of 10. Players can choose to "hit" for additional cards or "stand" to keep their current hand. The dealer also plays. The objective is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21. A blackjack, an Ace with a 10-value card, is the best hand.

This version of blackjack is just two players, the person on the computer and the dealer(the program).Upon running, both players will automatically be dealt in. You will be able to see your cards as well as one of the dealers cards. Given that there is one card needed to make 21 in your hand, the program will display the probability of getinng that card. It will also display the probability of winning and the player advantage. After being dealt the cards, you are given the option to "hit" or "stay" and you give your choice by typing it out and hitting enter. If you choose to hit, the probabilities will again be shown given that you do not bust(go over 21). After your turn is over, the dealer will take its turn. After both parties choose to stay the cards will be shown and the player revealed.

The player advantage is calculated by taking the probability that the dealer has a higher overall hand value than the player based on the shown card. This gives the probability that the dealer is currently winning. The players probability of winning is calculated by subtracting the dealers probability from 100. Then the player advantage is given by the players probability of winning minus the dealers probability of winning. The probabilities are all based on a one deck of cards game.
